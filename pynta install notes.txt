When creating a virtual environment it's important to realize that not all pyton versions will work.
One version that does work is 3.6.8

Extra install requirements for the rust modules

You could try to start with step 2. If it warns about C++ Build Tools, abort and do step 1 first.

1)
Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2019
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
(When prompted with many checkboxes, I think the C++ bit is enough) (i.e. first choice top left)

Make sure that the following optional tools are selected (on the right):
- MSVC
- Windows 10 SDK
- C++ CMake tools
Other optional options may be deselected

Reboot required

2)
Install rust compiler
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

(Note: you may need to restart your "shell/terminal" )

3)
Install rust_setuptools in the virtual environment:
pip install rust_setuptools

4)	newly added::::::::::::::

https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html
Points to this page:
https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
Which points to github for pre-built binaries:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-13.0.0
LLVM-13.0.0-win64.exe

While installing, I selected "Add LLVM to the system PATH for current user"

5)
# Install rust_modules/pynta_drive_glue/pynta_drivers:
# navigate to rust_modules\pynta_drive_glue\
python setup.py install




6) dcam stuff


When #![feature] error occurs during compiling rust code, switch to nightly:
rustup default nightly

(to update: rustup update)
(to use stable: rustup default stable)
